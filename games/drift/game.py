"""Drift — Climate Migration & Displacement Game.

Runs in-browser via Pyodide. Milestone 1: the core allocation loop — a
receiving region invests its budget across housing, integration
services, and infrastructure capacity, round by round. Displacement
pressure, strain, integration payoff, and composite scoring land in
later milestones; this milestone is just "can the region build
capacity at all."
