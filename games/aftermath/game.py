Runs in-browser via Pyodide. A repeated-short-run core loop: a fixed

resource allocation between events (resilience vs. growth investment),
and damage resolution, feeding a persistent cross-run skill tree and
"how far you've come" run comparison. See CLAUDE.md for the full

# only — the current RunState (run_number, event_index, resources,
# resilience_capacity, growth_capacity, damage_taken, event_log) — which
# is what needs to round-trip so a saved-and-reloaded run resumes at the
# exact point it was saved. The persistent skill tree (SkillTreeState),
# run_history, and legacy_events are deliberately NOT part of this
# round trip: per CLAUDE.md's Tech notes, those are a distinct,
# already-working persistence mechanism keyed to localStorage (not to a
# save code) that survives across runs and browser visits on its own.
# Folding them into this save system would mean a loaded save code could
# silently overwrite a browser's separately-accumulated skill tree with
# whatever it looked like at save time — the wrong behavior for state
# that's supposed to be permanent. A save code loaded on a different
# browser/device therefore resumes the exact in-progress run, but keeps
# whatever skill tree/legacy history (or lack of it) already exists
# locally — consistent with how that persistence already behaves
# independent of any one run.
